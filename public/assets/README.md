# The `public.assets` Directory

There's really not much to say here. This folder should contain all fonts, images, ect. Any project 'assets' if you will.

Fonts will be automatically copied over to the main fonts folder on the root of 'public' if you are running ``grunt watch`. To manually copy them over you can run `grunt install:fonts`, this task copies your local fonts as well as the Foundation-Icon fonts.
